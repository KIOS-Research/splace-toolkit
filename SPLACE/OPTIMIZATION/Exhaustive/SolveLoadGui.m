% In This M file you can see how the axes along with a patch can be used to
% render a progress bar for your existing Gui. Box Property of the Axes
% must be enabled in order to make the axes look like a progress bar and
% also the xTick & yTick values must be set to empty. In order to change
% the Color of the Patch do pass the color value to changecolor function.
% Run this m file and click on the start button to see how this progress bar works.
