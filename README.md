==============

The `Sensor Placement (S-PLACE) Toolkit' is used for computing at which locations to install contaminant sensors in water distribution systems to reduce the impact risks. The S-PLACE Toolkit is build on the mathematical framework previously proposed (Eliades and Polycarpou, 2010) and it has been designed to be user-friendly and modular, suitable for both the professional and the research community. The Toolkit is programmed in Matlab utilizing the EPANET libraries. The modular software architecture allows each module to be accessed independently through stand-alone functions. Furthermore, the Toolkit allows the user to add, modify or remove methods and network elements, as well as to program new functions. The use of the software is illustrated using benchmark networks which capture different types of real network topologies, such as looped and branched networks.
